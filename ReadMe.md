# Gitlab-Teams-Connector

**Important Notice:**

> This project is part of a learning project of mine. I wanted to get a feel for the difference between different programming languages. In my case Elixir, Ruby and Python.
> This is the python version of the app/helper. There exist multiple gitlab-teams-connectors with different feature sets in [my profile](https://github.com/Wachiwi?utf8=âœ“&tab=repositories&q=gitlab-teams-connector&type=&language=).
